/**
 * Promote the build THIS SHIP uploaded into the app's EXTERNAL beta group.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (CT-2434, 2026-10-19):  the Congress.Trade Public Beta group
 * (external, public link, three testers) served build 202608311519, uploaded
 * 2026-08-31, while every other fleet app's external group tracked the current
 * build.  Nothing refreshed it:  external beta promotion was only wired into
 * BotFleet and Clutch (asc-api.mjs ensure-standing-testers), and this repo's
 * ios-ship.yml had no such step.  That one build expired 2026-11-29, after
 * which the public link served nothing at all.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, in order:
 *   1. find the app's external beta group,
 *   2. find the ONE build it was asked to promote -- by build number, exactly,
 *   3. add that build to the group (idempotent),
 *   4. submit that build for Beta App Review when Apple wants a submission.
 *
 * WHY IT MATCHES A BUILD NUMBER AND NEVER "THE NEWEST BUILD"
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * The repo's own vendored client says this out loud, in
 * scripts/ios-fleet/asc-api.mjs (ensure-tf-ready):
 *
 *   "CFBundleVersion is known exactly at archive time (ship-testflight.sh
 *    passes it to xcodebuild as CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION) and ASC ingests it
 *    verbatim as builds[].attributes.version, so it is an exact key.  There is
 *    deliberately NO 'newest build' fallback: that fallback IS the defect."
 *
 * "Newest" is wrong for the first minutes after an upload:  the newest build
 * App Store Connect knows about is then the PREVIOUS ship.  A promotion that
 * picks "the newest" therefore promotes a build nobody asked it to promote,
 * and a promotion that waits for "the newest" waits for the wrong build.
 *
 * So this script takes a build number -- the CFBundleVersion the ship used --
 * and looks it up by that exact key.  When the build is not there yet, or is
 * still processing, it says so loudly and promotes nothing.  It never falls
 * back to a different build:  a wrong promotion is worse than a late one,
 * because the wrong one looks like success.
 *
 * The build number normally comes from the ship itself:  the fleet script
 * numbers a build as the checkout's commit count and logs it as
 * "marketing=1.0.<n> build=<n>", so the ship workflow hands that number over.
 * Without one, this script falls back to the same commit count, which is what
 * the ship starts from.
 *
 * Auth:  every App Store Connect call goes through the vendored
 * scripts/ios-fleet/asc-api.mjs, which owns credential handling.  This file
 * never reads, holds or prints a credential, and it never mutates the vendored
 * pin (scripts/ios-fleet/check-drift.sh compares that pin by sha256).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/promote-external-beta.mjs [--apple-id <id>] [--group <name>]
 *                                           [--build <n>]
 *
 * Exit codes:  0 done or nothing to do  |  3 partial (warnings printed).
 * The ship workflow treats a non-zero exit as a warning and never lets it fail
 * the TestFlight ship.
